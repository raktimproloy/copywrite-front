      Search and purchase your preferred domain
    </h3>
    <p>
      Choosing the right domain name is one of the most important
      steps in setting up your website. Your domain name is how
      people will find you online, so it's important to choose one
      that is easy to remember and spells out what your business
      is about. <br /> <br />
      There are a few different things to consider when choosing
      your domain name:
      <ul>
        <li> It should be easy to spell and pronounce </li>
        <li> It should be relevant to your business </li>
        <li> It should be short and memorable</li>
        <li> It should be available as a .com</li>
      </ul>
      If you're having trouble coming up with a domain name, try
      brainstorming with a friend or using a domain name
      generator. Once you've found a few potential names, check to
      see if they're available as a .com by doing a quick search
      online. Once you've found your perfect domain name, you can
      purchase it through a domain registrar like
      <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> GoDaddy </a>
      or
      <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Namecheap </a>
      .
    </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">
      Select a hosting provider for your website
    </h3>

    <p>
      There are many things to consider when selecting a hosting
      provider for your website. The most important factor to
      consider is whether the provider offers the features and
      services that you need. Some of the features to look for
      include unlimited storage, bandwidth, email accounts, and a
      free domain name. Another important factor to consider is
      the provider's customer support. Make sure that the provider
      offers 24/7 customer support so that you can always get help
      when you need it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">
      Create a website structure that is easy to navigate and
      understand
    </h3>

    <p>
      One of the most important aspects of SEO that is often
      overlooked is the structure of a website. Having a
      well-defined framework and site structure can improve your
      ranking, and authority, and make it easier for search
      engines to crawl your pages. It can also create a better
      overall user experience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">Configure a sitemap for your website</h3>
    <p>
      Sitemap files help search engines index your website and
      understand its structure. By including a sitemap file on
      your website, you're providing search engines with valuable
      information that can help them understand your site better
      and improve their search results.
      <br /> <br />
      Here are some tips for creating and submitting a sitemap
      file for your website:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use a sitemap generator tool to create your sitemap
          file. There are many free and paid sitemap generator
          tools available online.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your sitemap file is well-formed and valid.
          You can use a tool like the W3C Markup Validation
          Service to check your sitemap file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Submit your sitemap file to search engines. Submit a
          Site map on all major site engine.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://search.google.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
              >
                Google Search Console
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
              >
                Bing Webmaster Tools
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://webmaster.yandex.com/welcome/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
              >
                Yandex Webmaster Tools
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your sitemap file up to date. As you make
          changes to your website, be sure to update your sitemap
          file accordingly.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">Use Friendly Permalinks</h3>

    <p>
      One important tip for technical SEO success is to use
      friendly permalinks. A permalink is the web address used to
      link to your blog post or web page. It is important to use
      descriptive and keyword-rich permalinks so that search
      engines can easily index and rank your content.
      Additionally, using friendly permalinks will make it easier
      for users to find and share your content.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">Request Crawling for Faster Indexing</h3>

    <p>
      By default, Googlebot crawls the Internet with a particular
      focus on new websites and pages. However, if you want your
      website or specific pages to be indexed more quickly, you
      can submit a request to Google for them to be crawled. There
      are two ways to do this: first, you can use the Fetch as
      Google tool in Search Console, which allows you to request
      individual URLs; or second, you can submit a sitemap, which
      is a file that contains a list of all the URLs on your
      website. Both of these methods are quick and easy to do, and
      they can help to speed up the process of getting your
      website indexed. In addition, if you have a large website or
      if your website is updated frequently, submitting a sitemap
      can be a helpful way to ensure that all of your pages are
      included in the Google index.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">
      Perform a search engine optimization audit each month
    </h3>

    <p>
      It's important to stay on top of your website's SEO health
      by conducting monthly audits. This will help you catch any
      issues that may have arisen and fix them before they cause
      serious problems. Here are some tips for conducting
      effective monthly audits:
      <ol class="blog-ol">
        <li>
          Choose a day or week that you will dedicate to your
          audit. This way, you won't have to worry about fitting
          it into your busy schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a list of all the things you need to check. This
          may include things like your website's code, structure,
          content, links, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your time and go through each item on your list.
          Don't rush the process, as you may miss something
          important.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep a log of any issues you find. This will help you
          track your progress and see which areas need
          improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a plan to fix any issues you find. This may involve
          making changes to your website's code, structure,
          content, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      By following these tips, you can ensure that your website's
      SEO is in good health.
