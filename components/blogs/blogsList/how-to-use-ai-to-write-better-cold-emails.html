    <h3 class="h5 mt-5">What is a cold email and how does it differ from other emails?</h3>
    <p>
      A cold email is an unsolicited email that is sent to a potential customer or client. It is different from other types of emails because it is not sent in response to an inquiry or request. Cold emails are typically sent by salespeople and businesses in an attempt to generate leads and initiate contact with potential customers. The main goal of a cold email is to get the recipient to respond so that further communication can take place.<br></br>

      Because cold emails are unsolicited, they can often be viewed as spam. To avoid this, it is important to make sure that your cold email is well-written and relevant to the recipient. You should also include a clear call-to-action (CTA) so that the recipient knows what you want them to do next.
